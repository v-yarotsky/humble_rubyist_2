The Beer WM
===========

Once upon a time, when I found out about tiling window managers, I got upset because of their absence on OS X.
I started searching for solutions then. Through Divvy and Spectacle, ShiftIt and Flexiglass, I reached Moom - the
only tool in town which allowed quite flexible keyboard control over my cluttered desktop. It didn't fit
the best way it could, though. I started dreaming about implementing my own WM, but Objective C and Cocoa API
seemed daunting to me, and I put it off. Until I stumbled upon [Zephyros](https://github.com/sdegutis/zephyros).
After playing around with it a bit I was convinced it could replace all features of Moom I needed, and I could add
my own!. The most intriguing part is that I could make it using Ruby. Thus [Beer](https://github.com/v-yarotsky/beer)
was brewed.

It's main advantage over [other Zephyros client scripts](https://github.com/sdegutis/zephyros/wiki#other-users-configs) available
is that it creates a window-management "mode", which is triggered by a single shortcut.

Once you activate mode, you can move a window around, and then dismiss the mode. It eliminates the need
of complicated shortcuts for each action.

Currently, [Beer](https://github.com/v-yarotsky/beer) supports the following actions:

`Ctrl+Alt+W` - enable window management mode

* `Up`           - top half of window's screen
* `Down`         - bottom half of window's screen
* `Left`         - left half of window's screen
* `Right`        - right half of window's screen
* `Up, Left`     - top left quarter of window's screen
* `Up, Right`    - top right quarter of window's screen
* `Down, Left`   - bottom left quarter of window's screen
* `Down, Right`  - bottom right quarter of window's screen
* `Enter`        - maximize window
* `Left, Left`   - move window to previous screen
* `Right, Right` - move window to next screen
* `W`            - focus window to the top
* `S`            - focus window to the bottom
* `A`            - focus window to the left
* `D`            - focus window to the right
* `Esc`          - dismiss window-management mode (it's dismissed automatically on action though)
