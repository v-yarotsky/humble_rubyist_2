Prj
===

Tired of typing ``cd ~/Projects/foobar``?
[Prj](https://github.com/v-yarotsky/prj) can save you some keystrokes :)

<!-- more -->

1. Install the gem

    ```sh
    gem install prj
    ```

2. Put the following snippet into your .zshrc

    ```sh
    function p() {
      builtin cd "$(prj $1)"
    }
    ```

3. Reload .zshrc

    ```sh
    source ~/.zshrc
    ```

4. Put a project root directory name into ~/.prj, i.e:

    ```sh
    echo "projects_root: ~/Projects" > ~/.prj.yml
    ```

Now you can type ``p fba``, and it will take you to ~/Projects/foobar
