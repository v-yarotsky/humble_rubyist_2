Taketo
======

[Taketo](https://github.com/v-yarotsky/taketo) is a tiny helper utility to make access to servers easier for different projects and environments.

<!-- more -->

Put the following content in ``~/.taketo.rc.rb``

```ruby
project :rainbowunicorns do
  environment :staging do
    server do
      host "staging.rainbowunicorns.com"
      location "/mnt/apps/rainbowunicorns"
      env :TERM => "xterm-256color"
      user "boss"
      identity_file "~/.ssh/my_uber_secret_key"
    end
  end
end
```

Then run:

``taketo rainbowunicorns``

This is what you would have to type to do the same thing:

    ssh -t -i ~/.ssh/my_uber_secret_key boss@staging.rainbowunicorns.com \
    "cd /mnt/apps/rainbowunicorns; RAILS_ENV=staging TERM=xterm-256color bash"

Nuff said :)
