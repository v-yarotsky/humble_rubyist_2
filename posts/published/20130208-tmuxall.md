Tmuxall
=======

Well, [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/) does not have N-rows 2-columns layout, and I really do want it to have such one.
What typical rubyist does in this situation? Bingo! Writes some code!

So, here we go: [tmuxall](https://github.com/v-yarotsky/tmuxall)

<!-- more -->

1. Install the gem

  ```sh
  $ gem install tmuxall
  ```

2. Run some commands in tmux

  ```sh
  $ cat | tmuxall
  > htop
  > ls -l\
  > -a
  > ssh my_home
  > cat TODO | grep beer
  >  <Ctrl+D>
  ```

3. ...

4. Profit!

This is going to be especially awesome with [taketo](https://github.com/v-yarotsky/taketo), when the latter reaches v0.2.0.
What you will be able to do is login to a bunch of servers instantly, like this:

```sh
$ taketo my_project:frontends --list | sed 's/^/taketo /' | tmuxall
```
